# prompter
A faux-teleprompter that reads off an Oath of Office.

# How to Use
You press any key to continue and the prompter will show you line by line the text that is hardcoded into the file. This is great for something where you are trying to directly control what someone is going to say (like an SGA Oath of Office for example).

It prompts for a role right now, as that's SGA's use case, but it could easily be removed and modified to your needs.
